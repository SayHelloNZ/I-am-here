# I-am-here

Hey there, 

I'm  Tracy and although I'm not an engineer, I'd like to learn! I founded a recruitment company called Say Hello and I'm hiring developers for start-ups and software companies across the globe. When I'm not working hard on finding talented people jobs with rad companies, I'm out hitting the pavement for a long distance run or relaxing with a beer in hand. 

Feel free to get in touch! sayhello.co.nz
